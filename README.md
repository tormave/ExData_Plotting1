## Exploratory Data Analysis - Week 1 Assignment

### Introduction
Hello, fellow student. I'm right off the bat going to confess that there's something different in my data than in the examples. The Fridays look the same as in the examples, but the Thursdays look different. I've no idea why, maybe you can point this out in the comments, if you've figured that out.

### Scripts
As a computer scientist I loathe this, but all the common code is just copy pasted into every script, because that's basically what the instructions stated. So there's plot1.R, ..., plot4.R, and the corresponding plot1.png, ..., plot4.png. I think the plots are pretty close to the target ones, especially given the discrepancy in the data.
